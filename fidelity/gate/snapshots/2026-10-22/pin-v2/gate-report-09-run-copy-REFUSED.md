# Fidelity gate report

**Verdict: REFUSED** (0 gating item(s) vs the previous link, 54 vs the chain head fidelity/baselines/port/00-start; 0 flagged WPT pass(es) lost, reported, not gating; 0 value(s) worse within tolerance, listed, not gating; pin view: merge to main BLOCKED, 66 (c) item(s)). Local macOS runs are INDICATIVE.

## Head ratchet vs fidelity/baselines/port/00-start (GATE-H1): REFUSED

Every item worse than the chain head beyond its tolerance gates unless a class-a acceptance of this step (0 counted, 0 legacy/other ignored) or a DEBT.json entry within its ceiling covers it. Counts: head-regression 54, gating 54, improvement 1059, withinTolerance 0, flaggedPassLost 5.

## Per group

| group | classes |
|---|---|

## Tolerances

| class | tolerance | label | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| position-mm | 0.1 mm | DESIGN TARGET | word/anchor position error vs a reference (REF-W max/p95, REF-R worst anchor, DANFE-L1, LET-1). 0.1 mm (0.28 pt, 0.38 CSS px) is 10x the 0.01 mm the values are reported with and below one CSS px (0.26 mm), the smallest step a px-snapping layout can move; the measurement is deterministic for one build and one reference (CONFIRMED: equal inputs gave equal values in the Phase A repeat run). |
| geometry-excess-mm | 0.05 mm | DESIGN TARGET | distance OUTSIDE a specification window (BOL-G*, DANFE-B*, DANFE-M1, TXT-A1). Inside the window the spec admits any value, so only the excess is ratcheted; 0.05 mm is about one 600 dpi raster pixel (0.042 mm), the measurement quantum of measure_bars.py / the page ink box. |
| font-excess-pt | 0.05 pt | SPEC-derived tolerance unit | font-size excess outside a window; 0.05 pt is the tolerance ACCEPTANCE.md already applies to every font-size criterion (BOL-T*, DANFE-F*). |
| count | 0 count | DESIGN TARGET | integer counts from deterministic tools (required strings found, extractor missing/extra tokens, segments/glyphs attributed, decoded symbols): any loss is a real change of the document. |
| page-delta | 0 pages | DESIGN TARGET | \|vellora pages - reference pages\|: a page break moving is never noise. |
| pdf-probe-pt | 1 pt | DESIGN TARGET | per-word \|dx\| / \|dy\| of vellora's PDF vs Chrome's PDF (pdf-probe semantics 2: PyMuPDF pen origin and baseline, same-page position pairs keyed by the Chrome word). 1 pt (0.35 mm) is an order of magnitude below the Phase A regressions it must catch (invoice price column +9 pt, notification signature -14 pt) and above the 0.01 pt rounding of the probe and sub-px snapping differences. The per-fixture unpaired-word counts use the count class. |
